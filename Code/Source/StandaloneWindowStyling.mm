// Keeps the traffic lights repositioned for as long as the window lives. AppKit re-lays them out
// to their own cramped default position on its own whenever the window is shown/made key or
// resized - including continuously throughout an interactive/live resize drag - so a one-off
// repositioning (or one merely deferred a run-loop turn via dispatch_async, which doesn't reliably
// get serviced while AppKit's live-resize tracking loop is running) gets silently undone moments
// later. Observing NSWindowDidResizeNotification reacts synchronously, on the very native event
// that causes AppKit's own reset, so there's no race to lose.
//
// This project's Objective-C++ files aren't built with ARC (see JUCE's own .mm files, which use
// explicit retain/release throughout), so this is written the same way: a bare (non-retaining)
// pointer back to the window - retaining it would create a reference cycle, since the window is
// what keeps this object alive in the first place, via objc_setAssociatedObject below.
